 <p style="text-align:justify;"> With the cost of living always rising, everyone is looking to save a dollar wherever they can. Vehicles are bought
     on a large scale since the targeted age group can be between 16 and over, depending on the country of residence. When one buys a vehicle,
	 probably the biggest deciding factor for the majority is the price of the desired vehicle. Yes, you will have to dig into your wallet for that 
     beginning expense but another factor has to be considered relating to cost, the cost of gas for the X number of years you will be driving that said same vehicle.
	 With the market of vehicles so huge there is a large variety of gas prices per year. Think of how much fuel is needed to power a 1.3 litre car compared to a 5 litre 4WD pick-up truck.
The specifics of a car will also cause variation in the insurance costs per year. Another important factor (to some more important than others) is how environmental friendly the vehicle is.
There are a few goals associated with this website. We want to allow users to view information of a vehicle before making the purchase so they can have an idea of the future cost associated with the vehicle 
and also how damaging it is to the environment. A future goal in the making is to allow users to select a vehicle and route and the application will inform the user how much the trip will cost in gas. This will be very helpful when planning a road trip that is longer than the average drive.
